    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Puppet 2.7, one of the new features added was device management. In this initial release, only a small number of Cisco switches were supported. Overall the capabilities weren’t really signifcant, however the concept shifted people’s perception of the boundaries for configuration management. All of sudden Puppet didn’t end at the operating system, and extended to black boxes that were previously thought to be a bridge too far.</p>

<p><img src="http://nanliu.github.com/images/inception_dream.gif" title="'dream big'" /></p>

<p>This slowly spawned a flurry of activities exploring network devices, load-balancers, and storage:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/junos-puppet0.8/topics/concept/automation-junos-puppet-overview.html">Juniper</a><sup id="fnref:fn-juniper"><a href="#fn:fn-juniper" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>: <a href="https://github.com/jeremyschulman/puppet-netdev">puppet-netdev</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://devcentral.f5.com/blogs/us/f5-friday-how-to-stop-running-the-project-gauntlet-of-doom-with-devops">F5 Big-IP</a>: <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-f5">puppetlabs-f5</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/fatmcgav/netapp">Net App</a>: <a href="https://github.com/fatmcgav/fatmcgav-netapp">fatmcgav-netapp</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The benefits of having the entire infrastracture automated with a single tool chain under version control is indisputable. A Software Define Data Center is not complete until you gap the management capabilities whether it’s your network or storage. </p>

<p>It’s clear after working with devices that any attempt to automate them must leverage their respective APIs. Without Netconf, iControl, NetApp SDK, non of the modules would been possible. Automation built purely around CLI interactions and output parsing would be extremely brittle.</p>

<p>Next week at <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/partner-exchange">VMware Partners Exchange</a> (PEX 2013), <a href="http://nickapedia.com/2013/02/01/stuff-to-see-puppet-pex-and-more/">Nick Weaver</a> and Carl Caum will present more about Puppet and how it works with VMware Products at session VPN1298. We plan to provide VMware users with a set of Puppet modules for management of vCenter/vShield (vCloud Network and Security):</p>

<p><img src="http://nanliu.github.com/images/puppet_device.png" title="'Puppet and vSphere vShield API'" /></p>

<p>Currently, puppet devices can only communicate with a single device at a time. After working with vShield API, it’s clear we needed the capabilities to communicate with multiple devices due to it’s dependency of <a href="http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1017126">vSphere Managed Object Reference (MoRef)</a>. ‘esx-13’ might be understandable to a computer, but for configuration purpose ‘test_esx_host’ would make much more sense to an admin. </p>

<p>For this reason, we developed transport resource to support ssh, vSphere, and vShield connectivity for a single puppet execution:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am a bit late to the Puppet 3.0 party, since 3.1 have been released recently<sup id="fnref:fn-semver"><a href="#fn:fn-semver" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. After reading the <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/3/reference/release_notes.html">release notes</a> and <a href="http://somethingsinistral.net/blog/the-angry-guide-to-puppet-3/">“The Angry Guide to Puppet 3”</a>, I thought most of the upgrade issues have been covered, but there was still a small surprise when it comes to types and providers.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/3/reference/release_notes.html#exec">Exec resource</a> had a small behavior change noted as: “Due to misleading values, the HOME and USER environment variables are now unset when running commands.”</p>

<p>The impact is a bit more significant than updating Exec resource since it also affects commands declared in providers. If the invoked command depends on the HOME environment variables such as brew, it will fail in Puppet 3:</p>

<pre><code>Error: /Stage[main]//Package[rbenv]:
Could not evaluate: Could not list packages:
Execution of '/usr/local/bin/brew list --versions rbenv' returned 1:
/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/pathname.rb:853:in `expand_path':
couldn't find HOME environment -- expanding `~/Library/Caches/Homebrew' (ArgumentError)

from /usr/local/bin/brew:17
</code></pre>

<p>The solution is described in <a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/16779">#16779</a>:</p>

<p>The method ‘has_command’ is not backwards compatible with Puppet 2.x, so we need to wrap it around some version check:</p>

<p>This also means execute will strip these two environment variables as well, so commands pass :custom_environment to preserve this value. execute is less common, and don’t use it unless you need special behavior such as :failonfail =&gt; false:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

    <id>http://nanliu.github.com/blog/2013/01/02/new-year-reboot</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the last two and half year, I lived, breathed, and spent my waking hours thinking about Puppet. In a blink of an eye Puppet Labs is no longer the 12 person startup above Old Town Pizza shop<sup id="fnref:fn-pizza"><a href="#fn:fn-pizza" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> or more infamously, above the start of the Shanghai Tunnel <sup id="fnref:fn-shanghai"><a href="#fn:fn-shanghai" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> in China Town. </p>

<p><img src="http://nanliu.github.com/images/reductive.jpg" title="'Seriously, this was it.'" /></p>

<p>The company can probably can start shedding the term startup, since it’s 10x the size, closed a third round investment, and finished their third office move to the Pearl district.</p>

<p>Looking back, I still pinch myself for even getting the opportunity to be in Portland since I started the job knowing little about the software. I’m still amused by the interview with the other candidate in the same room that felt like a reality TV show<sup id="fnref:fn-interview"><a href="#fn:fn-interview" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. Fast forward 200,000 miles around the world later and I’m finally feeling comfortable using and talking about Puppet. It’s been an incredible ride, and more important I’ve been lucky to work with some of the brightest people I know. If you enjoy solving infrastructure problems, <a href="http://www.jobscore.com/jobs/puppetlabs">apply and have a blast</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a New Year, and I’m sad it’s time for a reboot and I’ve left Puppet Labs to join VMware as a Sr. Systems Engineer under R&amp;D. As usual a new shiny problem has presented itself and I’m diving head first into the unknown.</p>

<p>However I’m not saying goodbye to the Puppet community. A glimps of what’s to come should be announced at <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/partner-exchange">VMware Partners Exchange 2013</a>. Here’s to 2013.</p>

    <updated>2013-01-01T10:21:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://nanliu.github.com/blog/2013/01/01/from-typhoon-to-computers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Translations tend to have this weird effect of imbuing additional meanings the original language didn’t intend to contain. One of the possible origins for the word Typhoon is the Chinese pronunciation of “East Wind”(东风) <sup id="fnref:fn-jstor"><a href="#fn:fn-jstor" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Interestingly enough, the word has been imported back to Chinese phonetically as “Typhoon”(台风) with a completely different meaning than the original word east wind.</p>

<p>There’s two translations of the word computers in Chinese: “计算机” and “电脑”. If we go through the typhoon exercise and translate them back to English. The first, “Computing Machine”, is not far off from the original meaning, but the second, “Electronic Brain”, seems far more imaginative; especially compared to what computer systems were able to achieve when these words were first translated.</p>

<p>When I started working on computers, machines were simply waiting for the next human instruction, the tools for managing them doesn’t really mask the rather tedious task. </p>

<p><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tar.png" title="'tar -xvf'" /></p>

<p>However with latest generation of configuration management software, I finally feel like we started building solutions to tackle the automation problem in a fundamental way. Similar to the insight in Stephen Wolfram’s book “A New Kind of Science”, complexity can be derive from simple rules, the inverse also appears be true: “complex systems can be managed with simple tools following basic rules chained together”.</p>

<p><img src="http://nanliu.github.com/images/wolfram.png" title="'Wolfram substitution systems models growth of plants'" /></p>

<p>We are certainly nowhere near having all the right building blocks for deploying and managing self healing infrastructure, but it’s a great aspiration to build better automation and be one small step closer towards the “Electronic Brain”. </p>
